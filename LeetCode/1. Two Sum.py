# Input: an array "arr", a starting index "low", an ending index "high"
# Output: array "arr" with its elements from index low to index high sorted
# in ascending order

# Example:
#
# INPUT:
# arr = [3, 2, 9, 8, 5, 6, 0]
# low = 1
# high = 5
#
# OUTPUT:
# index  0  1  2  3  4  5  6
# arr = [3, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 0]
